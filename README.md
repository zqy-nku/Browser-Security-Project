## Summary
For this project, we are conducting CSS injection attacking expriments on our self-developed ChatRoom web application and a simple React victim page. We explore static data exfiltration, dynamic data exfiltration and defense mechanisms. For static data exfiltration, we steal CSRF Token with iFrames and without iFrames; for dynamic data exfiltration, we steal HTML text input with @font-face and steal input password with css keylogger.
